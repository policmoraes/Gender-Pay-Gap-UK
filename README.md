# Gender-Pay-Gap-UK Lab SQL

In this session we had a chance to practice ySQL skills on an unfamiliar data set, and walk through the stages of the data analysis workflow slightly more independently.We will go through the stages of:
1.Reading a data set
2.Formulating data science questions
3.Performing some cleaning and analysis, and finally
4.Communicating our findings

The client is a UK government department, concerned withmonitoring the gender pay gap across different industries.
Using our new SQL skills, your task is to independentlyexplore a data set to understand:

We were encouraged to explore the data.
Letâ€™s take some time to do this, and specifically think about:
- Is the data from an official source?
- How is the data compiled and reported?
- What kinds of metrics are collected?
- Who has to take part in the reporting process?
- What are some limitations associated with the data set?
- How reliable is the data?Be ready to share your thoughts!


Some of the questions we will be answering today include:
- What is the average pay gap for companies across the UK?
- Are there differences between the average pay gaps across industries?
- Are there differences between the average pay gaps across different regions of the UK?
- What are some of the companies with the largest pay gaps?
